                    <p>For us, this restaurant is all about the view. The food is good and won’t disappoint, but what makes this venue stand out is the panoramic views of the city’s downtown. Enjoy Luxembourg at night from the Gare to the Grund with everything in between. They also have an exceptional cocktail bar made all the more enjoyable by the recent smoking ban. You don’t need a room in the hotel to dine in the restaurant but maybe after a night of spectacular views and drinks, you’ll want one!

                    <p>No other restaurant in Tokyo has a setting to rival Kozue. Perched far above the fray on the 40th floor of the Park Hyatt, Kozue is still as swish as the day it opened in 1994, with a contemporary look (soaring ceiling, stylish tables and chairs) to match the confident modern inflections on kaiseki (japan's version of haute cuisine). The menu features torafugu puffer fish in winter, ayu sweetfish in summer, matsutake mushrooms in autumn, and year-round shabu-shabu of perfectly marbled beef from premium wagyu cattle. Book a window seat to enjoy a peerless view of the western hills and even (if the weather gods are smiling) Mt Fuji's cone silhouetted in the distance.

                    <p>Asilo, which apparently means refuge or shelter in Spanish, does indeed provide a refreshing reprieve from the noisy chaos of Mumbai. This hot new bar, located on the 38th floor rooftop of the luxurious St. Regis hotel (formerly the Palladium hotel), has the honor of being Mumbai's highest bar (the St. Regis hotel has another highest bar, Li Bai, on the 37th floor too). If you're not coming for the sunset, expect to pay a full cover charge of 2,500 rupees (redeemable on food and beverages) after 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. There's a DJ and the bar fills up fast with an elite crowd.

Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro is a legendary for a reason: channeling authentic European Alpine culture in a warm, welcoming environment, it also happens to have the most boisterous après ski scene on any mountain in North America. Lunch service feels like a slice of Switzerland in the Rocky Mountains with layered helpings of fondue and raclette as well as steak tartare, caviar and delectable daily specials. The wine list includes an ever-changing array of international varieties and fine Champagne. For dessert: strudel, anyone? As everyone’s attention shifts from lunch to après ski, things really kick into high gear. On sunny days, the south-facing deck at Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro regularly plays host to ski-boot dance parties that just happen, as flutes of Champagne, glasses of fine wine and a bevy of cocktails create a jovial atmosphere.
